# CE888_Assignment

There are three main files that have been used for the tasks required in the CE888 Assignment 2. 

These are the .py files named ce888_emotion, ce888_hate, ce888_offensive that were used for the prediction using BERT.

I have also included the original notebooks that were used on collab while working on the code. These have the same naming convention but have the .ipynb extension. 

Lastly, I have provided a small algorithm (ce888_preprocessing) that was used to clean the tweet data early in the assignment. This needs the aspell.txt and contractions.csv files to run.
